        <div class="right"><img src="images/bald_eagle.jpg" alt="Bald Eagle"></div>
        <div class="left"><p>The Bald Eagle has been the national emblem of the United States since 1782 and a spiritual
         symbol for native people for far longer than that. These regal birds aren't really bald, but their white-feathered
          heads gleam in contrast to their chocolate-brown body and wings. Look for them soaring in solitude, 
          chasing other birds for their food, or gathering by the hundreds in winter. Once endangered by hunting and pesticides, 
          Bald Eagles have flourished under protection.</p></div>
   
        <div class="left"><img src="images/monkey.jpg" alt="monkey"></div>
        <div class="right"><p>Monkey is a common name that may refer to most mammals of the infraorder Simiiformes, also known as the simians. 
            Traditionally, all animals in the group now known as simians are counted as monkeys except the apes, 
            which constitutes an incomplete paraphyletic grouping; however, in the broader sense based on cladistics, 
            apes (Hominoidea) are also included, making the terms monkeys and simians synonyms in regards to their scope.</p></div>

        <div class="left"><p>Species of Aurelia can be found in the Atlantic, Arctic, Pacific and Indian Oceans, and seem to be more 
            common in temperate regions, such as in the waters off northern China, Japan, Korea, New Zealand, the northeastern and 
            northwestern coasts of the United States as well as the northern Europe.</p></div>

        <div class="left"><img src="images/Moon_Jellyfish.jpg" alt="Moon Jelly"></div>
        <div class="right"><p>Species of Aurelia can be found in the Atlantic, Arctic, Pacific and Indian Oceans, and seem to be more common in temperate regions, 
            such as in the waters off northern China, Japan, Korea, New Zealand, the northeastern and northwestern coasts of the United States as well as the northern Europe.[2]
            Aurelia undergoes alternation of generations, whereby the sexually-reproducing pelagic medusa stage is either male or female, and the benthic polyp stage reproduces asexually.</p></div>

        <div class="right"><img src="images/sea_horse.jpg" alt="Sea Horse"></div>
        <div class="left"><p> Unusually among fish, a seahorse has a flexible, well-defined neck. It also sports a crown-like spine or horn on its head, termed a "coronet", which is distinct for each species.[16]
            Seahorses swim very poorly, rapidly fluttering a dorsal fin and using pectoral fins to steer. The slowest-moving fish in the world is H. zosterae (the dwarf seahorse), with a top speed of about 1.5 m (5 ft) 
            per hour.[17] Since they are poor swimmers, they are most likely to be found resting with their prehensile tail wound around a stationary object.</p></div>
        
        <div class="left"><img src="images/whaleshark.webp" alt="Whale Shark"></div>
        <div class="right"><p> The Gulf of Maine study also found that the view of whales and other marine mammals as competitors for fishing, advocated by some nations, is incorrect as whales play a vital role in maintaining 
            the productivity of phytoplankton and consequently the fish. Culling marine mammal populations threatens the nutrient supply and the productivity of fishing grounds.
            n addition, the feces of krill-eating whales is rich in iron.[5] The release of iron from whale feces encourages the growth of phytoplankton in the sea,[5] 
            which not only benefits the marine food chain, but also sequesters carbon for long periods of time.</p></div>
